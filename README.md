# SARSA(λ) Grid-Based Visual Object Localization

This research implements a grid-based visual object localization system using the SARSA(λ) reinforcement learning algorithm. An agent is trained to navigate an image divided into tiles and identify the correct tile containing the target object using SIFT feature matching, ResNet-based similarity, and color histogram comparison.

## Overview

- **Environment**: A square image divided into an N×N grid of tiles (default 3×3).
- **Agent**: Trained via SARSA(λ) with eligibility traces and ε-greedy exploration.
- **Observation Space**: Current tile position (row, col).
- **Action Space**:
  - `0`: Move right  
  - `1`: Move down  
  - `2`: Move left  
  - `3`: Move up  
  - `4`: Attempt localization  
  - `5`: No-op (used for timing balance)
- **Reward Signal**:
  - Penalizes unnecessary movement and repeated visits  
  - Rewards accurate localization (based on SIFT + ResNet + color similarity)  
  - Bonus for confirming the correct tile and holding position
